## prerequisite collection

You will need to download and install the following software such that you can call them from any directory in your terminal or shell:

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Java Runtime Environment (JRE)](https://www.java.com/en/download/)

After you have installed the prerequisite software and cloned the repositiory, you can build the docker images, install dependencies, seed the database, and generate an API client library, via the command:

```
make newstart
```

Afterwards, for any future starts, you can execute this command for a more efficient start:

```
make start
```
